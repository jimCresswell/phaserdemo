==========

Playing with the [Phaser](http://phaser.io) tutorials.

Hosted version at http://jimcresswell.net/phaserdemo.

## Usage

The game needs to be served locally, use any static web server you like but if you install node you can:

`npm install` to install node http-server static file server.
`npm start` to start the static file server.


Phaser.io tutorials are in `/vendor/phaser_tutorial`.
